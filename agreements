WE WILL BE TALKING TOMORROW.

What will our domain name be?	
http://curbn.herokuapp.com/
We are using heroku

What will front end do?
Jeremy, look into bootstrap and look into our templates
Look into Oauth Authentication, this is for login and stuff


Back end language we are using is nodejs right?
That’ll be done in postgresql
Need to figure out how to get stuff working with aws services


What are you doing, DInorah?
Working on Postgresql
What do you need help with?

Things needing to be done:
Google Map API
Gas station price pulling, so we can calculate fairness in gas prices. We should all work with this.
Adding information to a feed, how do we that? 
•	We can do this by geo tag location, and event type.
•	And if an object is inserted or deleted from the database, then we should have a trigger flag that will pop up due to that creation.




Our Dynamic Data is Eventbrite, it will search through stuff every few data to crawl for things.
Also dynamic feed is like gas price is done.
Also will check if event is expired or if event has no tickets
After Thursday, we can focus on our report.
This is USA based stuff 

We will work on verification link later this
